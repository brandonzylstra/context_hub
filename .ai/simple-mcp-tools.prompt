SIMPLE MCP TOOLS
================

The idea here is to have a framework where an LLM can write
the code that is used in the MCP tool, and another LLM can
examine it to determine whether it is safe to run or not.

You could share these with others on the ContextHub.io site,
and anyone could rate something as safe, unsafe, questionable,
or uncertain, and give a reason for their rating.  This could
help you decide which MCP tools to trust, and which to avoid.

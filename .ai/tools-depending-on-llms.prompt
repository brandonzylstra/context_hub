Tools That Use LLMs


An LLM might need a tool, which itself depends on an LLM.  For example:

- An LLM could scan the code of a repo and detect style choices made in it, to set preferences for
  - spaces versus tabs
  - indentation size
  - whether trailing commas are accepted, rejected, or preferred
  - etc.

This meta data about the codebase can be cached in Context Hub, and made available to LLMs so that they don't need to gather this information all over again themselves.
